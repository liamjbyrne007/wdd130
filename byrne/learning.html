            <h1>D&D. How does it work?</h1>
            <p>There are several key parts of D&D that everyone should be aware of that will be briefly detailed here. First: an essential part of the game is about making stories. Second: one player is a dungeon master (DM) that acts to moderate the story and gameplay. Third: the rest of the players act as adventurers. Fourth: random chance is introduced to the game by dice.</p>

            <p>Storytelling: In the Player’s Handbook, the instruction manual for players, it reads that “The Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery.” It notes that can be like a make game of make believe, and that “together, the DM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. (Crawford, J., Wyatt, J., Schwalb, R. J., & Cordell, B. R. (2014). Player's handbook. Wizards of the Coast LLC.)</p>

            <p>The Dungeon Master: The DM plays an important role in the game, as it is they that decide the outcome of all outcomes, as they help to facilitate the interactions of the adventurers with the world they are in. As D&D is a game with rules, they can be thought of as referees at times.</p>
            <p>The Players: The players take the place of adventurers who are characters in the game that shape the story with their actions. They can choose what they want to try to do and how they want to act within the game, but they are limited by their abilities and the roll of the dice.</p>

            <p>The Dice: In D&D dice serve as the deciders of fate, as they can effect many things that adventurers do, whether that be how well the perform in a social situation, how well you can recall information, or if you hit the gobbling that is attacking you. The dice range in size from 4 to 100 sides, but the 20 sided die, or d20 is most often used.</p>
