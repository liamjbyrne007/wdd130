        D&D. How does it work?<br>
        There are several key parts of D&D that everyone should be aware of that will be briefly detailed here. First: an essential part of the game is about making stories. Second: one player is a dungeon master (DM) that acts to moderate the story and gameplay. Third: the rest of the players act as adventurers. Fourth: random chance is introduced to the game by dice.<br>
        Storytelling: In the Player’s Handbook, the instruction manual for players, it reads that “The Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery.” It notes that can be like a make game of make believe, and that “together, the DM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. (Crawford, J., Wyatt, J., Schwalb, R. J., & Cordell, B. R. (2014). Player's handbook. Wizards of the Coast LLC.)<br>
        The Dungeon Master: The DM plays an important role in the game, as it is they that decide the outcome of all outcomes, as they help to facilitate the interactions of the adventurers with the world they are in. As D&D is a game with rules, they can be thought of as referees at times.<br>
        The Players: The players take the place of adventurers who are characters in the game that shape the story with their actions. They can choose what they want to try to do and how they want to act within the game, but they are limited by their abilities and the roll of the dice.<br>
        The Dice: In D&D dice serve as the deciders of fate, as they can effect many things that adventurers do, whether that be how well the perform in a social situation, how well you can recall information, or if you hit the gobbling that is attacking you. The dice range in size from 4 to 100 sides, but the 20 sided die, or d20 is most often used.

      <h3>Page 3: Characters</h3>
      <p>
        Shown here are some examples of D&D characters, their stories, and characteristics.<br>
        Bhorgar Battlehammer: Bhorgar is a relatively young dwarf who is seeking adventure so he may prove himself worthy of his family’s legacy, a priceless set of armor and weapons. Contrary to common dwarvish tendency, he prefers to fight from range, often throwing his axes.<br>
        Greg: Greg is an ancient dwarf wizard, whose age is lost to time. He started adventuring because retirement was rather dull for him. Since setting off on the road, he’s had a much more exciting time, and he’s recently upset the power balance of the local goblin tribes after deposing their king.<br>
        Elder Joeferd: Elder Joeferd is a peculiar halfling who loves to think he’s in charge of everything. When he says everything like he is, people do what he says too. He’s also an excellent chef.

      <h3>Other Information</h3>
      <h4>Who?</h4>
      <p>
        I will now answer the question of who will come to my website, and that would be first: my family and friends who like D&D, second: anyone else who likes D&D, and third: anyone who might want to learn a little bit about D&D. For the people who don’t know very much about D&D I will include some information about it that will hopefully answer their basic questions about it. 
      </p>
      <h4>Why?</h4>
      <p>
        The reason people will come to my site would be for one of two reasons, either for a bit of entertainment, or to learn about D&D. The second page would primarily serve the entertainment purpose, while the third page of the website would serve more of the learning/teaching purpose.
      </p>
      <h4>What?</h4>
      <p>
        To answer the question of what info I’ll need to complete this website, I know that users will need at least basic knowledge of D&D, so I will provide that much to them on the third page, and access to resources that can help deepen their knowledge.
      </p>
      <h4>Why Me?</h4>
      <p>
        I think that visitors will come to my site instead of another similar one for fun. It will be the only place to learn about the stories of the characters that are described on the site.
