        <img src="styles/images/bhorgar_battlehammer_opt.jpg" alt="Bhorgar Battlehammer">
        <p>Bhorgar Battlehammer: Bhorgar is a relatively young dwarf who is seeking adventure so he may prove himself worthy of his family’s legacy, a priceless set of armor and weapons. Contrary to common dwarvish tendency, he prefers to fight from range, often throwing his axes.</p>
        <p>Greg: Greg is an ancient dwarf wizard, whose age is lost to time. He started adventuring because retirement was rather dull for him. Since setting off on the road, he’s had a much more exciting time, and he’s recently upset the power balance of the local goblin tribes after deposing their king.</p>

        <img src="styles/images/elder_joeferd_opt.jpg" alt="Elder Joefer, the halfling">
        <p>Elder Joeferd: Elder Joeferd is a peculiar halfling who loves to think he’s in charge of everything. When he says everything like he is, people do what he says too. He’s also an excellent chef.</p>
