    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>Well I'll tell you who I am, and maybe I'll even be able to include a photo of myself if I can help it.</p>
    <p>My name is Liam Byrne, I'm currently living in Washington state, and hve recently returned from a mission
    to Cincinnati. Before that I was actually attending BYUI in person, until they kicked me out because of Covid. Fun
    times. Anyways, I like many things nerdy. I like to read, I like games, I like the logical combination of the two
    found in Dungeons and Dragons. Let me think . . . oh yes! I also like to cook but only when I feel like it. My 
    current favorite writing utensils are fountain pens. They're so smooth. Oh wait this next piece of information
    may actually be of relative import to the subject at hand: I am currently a computer science major. Ok back to
    the fun stuff. As you will hopefully be able to see in my included picture, I have a dog, whose name is Dipper.
    He is rather unintelligent, but he makes up for it in happiness. I think that's about all I wanted to share at the moment.</p>
